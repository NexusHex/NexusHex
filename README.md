Hi there! I'm Nexus and I'm learning Python at an intermediate-advanced level.

I make pet projects for fun whenever I happen to get the idea, and can take any ideas that others would like me to implement in my code. If you would like to contact me, do so in the project comments in relation to your feedback or the latest iteration of the program that you are talking about.
