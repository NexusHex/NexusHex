Hi there! I'm Nexus (NexusHex) and I'm learning Python at an intermediate-advanced level.

I make pet projects for fun whenever I happen to get the idea, and I love it when others come and look at what I've created, and I thrive off the feedback they give me

If you have feedback or new ideas for me to code out, don't hesitate to contact me at my fodder email account - discordaccalt91@gmail.com (don't mind the name, it was just a temporary solution to an account issue I was having on Discord XD) and tell me everything you'd like me to know

Thanks for checking out my profile, and I hope you have a nice day!
